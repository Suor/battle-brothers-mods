# Retinue Promotions

Adds promotions for some retinue followers to make them better for extra one time investment without taking extra seat. Currently available promotions are:

**Bounty Hunter.** Further increases the chance of encountering champions. Costs 7000 gold.<br>
**Blacksmith.** Gives better chance to recover items, even broken ones, from slain enemies. Costs 3000 gold.<br>
**Cook.** Finds extra food after combat. Costs 2500 gold.<br>
**Drill Sergeant.** Training halls experience bonus is doubled. New hires get +70% experience in first 3 battles. Costs 3500.<br>
**Scavenger.** Doubles the spoils. Costs 3000 gold.<br>
**Trader.** Finds more stuff in shops, including rare named items. Costs 7000 gold.<br>
**Lookout.** Shows a faction of unscoutable locations and whether its treasury has named items. Costs 3500.<br>
**Surgeon.** Gives 15% chance to fix permanent injury on level up. Costs 3500.<br>

Also if [Sato's Balance Mod][sato-balance] is installed there will be a promotion for Guide:

**Guide.** Also makes company moves faster on normal terrain. Costs 9000 gold.<br>

To promote a follower you need to first hire him or her and then Ctrl-click on a picture in the retinue screen. If you replace a follower you loose the promotion.

More ideas are welcome.

## Compatibility

Is safe to add or remove mid-game. If you remove the mod promotions effects would be lost, will be back if you reinstall.

Plays nice with Expanded Retinue mod from [Tweaks and Fixes][tnf] and [More Retinue Member Slots
][more-retinue], i.e. all slots might be used and promotion is refunded on Right-click. Even fixes a bug in these two - when a folower is refunded the effects are reset immediately rather than on a next follower hire.


## Install

Download a zip from [NexusMods][] and put it into `data` dir. Requires [Modern Hooks][].
