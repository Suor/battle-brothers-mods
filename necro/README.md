# Proper Necromancer

Following the idea of [Recrutable Necromancer](old) this adds a Necromancer background, who can raise undead and possess them.

- gradually tap into the craft of controlling the undead via special perks
- pure mage or mage/fighter hybrid necromancer builds
- a dedicated origin
- loot and XP not lost anymore when zombie kills

Plans:

- check Necro morale when a possessed is hit/killed
- an event with a undead uprising to start chopping their heads
- more events
- special mechanics for origin or all necros


## Compatibility

Is safe to add midgame, can't remove once you have these guys anywhere including city hiring rosters. Compatible with most other mods.

Will play nice with [Autopilot New][autopilot] >= 2.5.0. Will work with Reforged.
