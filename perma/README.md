# Hackflow's Permanent Injuries

Aim for both fun and balance. Vanilla makes most permanent injuries an automatic kick out for a bro, now you may continue using him, maybe in a new manner.

Changes:

- add Missing Hand - can't use shields nor two-handed weapons
- make Missing Finger and Nose more interesing
- Brain Damage lowers pay a little, but otherwise unchanged
- cut most other penalties by half
