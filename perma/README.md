# Hackflow's Permanent Injuries

Aim for both fun and balance. Vanilla makes most permanent injuries an automatic kick out for a bro, now you may continue using him, maybe in a new manner.

Changes:

- cut most penalties by half
- add Missing Hand - can't use shields nor two-handed weapons
- make Missing Finger and Nose more interesting
- make Missing ear do nothing
- Brain Damage lowers pay a little, but otherwise unchanged (flavor and fun change)


## Compatibility

Is safe to add midgame, cannot remove if any of your bros have missing hand. Compatible with most other mods including Legends and Reforged.
